Detect pneumonia from chest x-ray images
Four experiments (exp1-4) from two variable are shown in this report. First variable is degree 10 and 90, and second variable is added color jitter on augmentation or not. Other hyperparameters are controlled at:
epoch = 10, figure size = 224x224, batch = 64, learning rate = 6e-6, decay = 0.9
